    <h1>What Is a Doppelganger?</h1>

    <p>Have you ever wondered if there’s someone in the world who looks exactly like you? That mysterious “face twin” is called a <strong>doppelganger</strong>.</p>

    <p>The word <strong>doppelganger</strong> comes from German: <em>“doppel”</em> meaning <strong>double</strong> and <em>“gänger”</em> meaning <strong>walker</strong> or <strong>goer</strong>. So, literally, it translates to “double-walker.” Over time, it has come to describe a person who looks almost identical to someone else, without sharing any biological relation.</p>

    <h2>Why Are People Fascinated by Doppelgangers?</h2>

    <p>Millions of people around the world are curious to find their doppelganger. The reasons are simple:</p>

      <li><strong>AI Technology:</strong> Modern AI can scan millions of images to find your closest look-alike in seconds.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>How AI Helps You Find Your Doppelganger</h2>

    <p>With advances in <strong>artificial intelligence</strong>, you no longer need to travel the world to find your twin. AI analyzes facial markers, skin tone, eye shape, and even subtle expressions to identify people who look like you.
